# hands-on-machine-learning

This repository contains all the code used in examples, figures, and results for Hands-On Machine Learning. The code has been adapted from [https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ageron/handson-ml3/blob/main/).

As I work through the book, I am working through the jupyter notebooks provided with the book.

## Copy and Paste
While it is theoretically possible to simply copy and paste the results from the Google Colab space into my own notebook, that would defeat the purpose of the work. To wit, I am hand-typing the code, so as to ensure I fully understand the code, and I can add commentary where my understanding falls short. I encourage anyone inspired to go through the book and provided notebooks to avoid copy-paste and to instead hand-write the code themselves.
